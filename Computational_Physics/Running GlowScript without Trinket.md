# Running GlowScript without Trinket

I ***strongly*** suggest running the GlowScript code using [Trinket](https://trinket.io/) since everything is built in and just works 'out of the box'.  However, if you *insist* on running the code on your own machine, I recommend using Jupyter.

I'm assuming that if you plan on running the code on your own machine that you are familiar enough with using and installing python packages that you don't need a step-by-step tutorial. If you do, let me know and I will try to make one here.

VPython does work with Jupyter, but it's currently in beta [(see here)](https://vpython.org/contents/announcements/get-vpython.html). Once you have your Jupyter Notebook environment set up (I couldn't get Jupyter Lab to work), make sure that you also have VPython installed correctly, possibly with `pip install python`. Then take the `.ipynb` file and run the code in on your machine.

If you can't get it to work and you still insist that this is the best way, then open an issue here and I will try to help you to get it working. But once again, I ***strongly*** suggest running the GlowScript code using [Trinket](https://trinket.io/).
