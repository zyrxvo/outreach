# Outreach
##### Resources for Public Outreach and Workshops on Various Topics.

These resources are free to use, modify, and distribute. Feel free to download everything, or just the presentations. The presentations are currently available as Keynote presentations, but the videos and images are not embedded, but they are also available as PDFs. If you would like them as PowerPoint presentations please let me know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/zyrxvo/public-outreach/issues) or emailing me at gbrown@physics.utoronto.ca.

## Computational Physics Workshops

### [Level 0: Objects in Motion](https://github.com/zyrxvo/public-outreach/tree/main/Computational_Physics/Level0)

**Approximate Length:** 1 hour

**Description:** Jump straight into programming with MIT's Scratch – an online platform to learn how to code using visual blocks. Go through, step-by-step, to make the cat move in a line and eventually a circle. Then transfer this knowledge into Python by writing your first Python program to do the same thing.

**Requirements:** A computer and browser with internet access for each participant. No programming experience required (MIT Scratch and Python). Tablets/iPads can work, but the experience is best with a desktop browser.

**Notes:** The workshop uses the online coding platforms [MIT's Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) and [Trinket](https://trinket.io/). The workshop utilizes the free tiers of these platforms to provide a no-mess approach to get started with programming.

### [Level 1: The Motion of Pendulums using Computers](https://github.com/zyrxvo/public-outreach/tree/main/Computational_Physics/Level1)

**Approximate Length:** 1-1.5 hours

**Description:** A brief review of how Newton's Laws can be used to describe the motion of objects. Starting from Newton’s 2nd Law, we will begin by discussing how to solve physics problems numerically. We will solve the motion of the simple pendulum numerically. We will then move on to experimenting with the double pendulum before closing on a discussion of chaos (as seen with the double pendulum). Finish by playing around with MinuteLabs' [Chaotic Pendulum](http://labs.minutelabs.io/Chaotic-Pendulum/). 

**Requirements:** A computer and browser with internet access for each participant. Little to no programming experience required (Python and JavaScript). Tablets/iPads can work, but the experience is best with a desktop browser.

**Notes:** The workshop uses the online coding platforms [Trinket](https://trinket.io/) and [p5.js](https://editor.p5js.org/). The workshop utilizes the free tiers of these platforms to provide a no-mess approach to get started with programming.

### [Level 2: Gravity and the Three Body Problem](https://github.com/zyrxvo/public-outreach/tree/main/Computational_Physics/Level2)

**Approximate Length:** 1.5-2 hours

**Description**: Starting from Newton’s 2nd Law, we will begin by discussing how to solve physics problems numerically along with a brief review of vectors (vector addition, vector magnitude, and unit vectors). We then solve the motion of the two-body problem numerically before stepping up to the three body problem. We finish with a brief discussion of chaos. Finish by playing around with MinuteLabs' [Chaotic Planets](http://labs.minutelabs.io/Chaotic-Planets/). 

**Requirements:** A computer and browser with internet access for each participant. Some programming experience would be helpful (Python). Tablets/iPads can work, but the experience is best with a desktop browser.

**Notes:** The workshop uses the online coding platform [Trinket](https://trinket.io/). The workshop Trinket to provide a no-mess approach to get started with programming in Python.

## Programming Workshops

### Level 0: Programming Plinko (Workshop, 1-2 hours)

**Approximate Length:** 1-2 hours

**Description**: Starting from no programming experience, we go through important concepts such as variables, if/else statements, while loops, for loops, functions, and exception handling as we create a basic digital version of Plinko using Python.

**Requirements:** No programming experience required (Python). A computer and browser with internet access for each participant, or Python installed locally. Tablets/iPads can work, but the experience is best with a desktop browser.
