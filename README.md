# Outreach
##### Resources for Public Outreach and Workshops on Various Topics.

These resources are free to use, modify, and distribute. Feel free to download everything, or just the presentations. The presentations are currently available as Keynote presentations with embedded videos and images, but they are also available as PDFs. If you would like them as PowerPoint presentations please let me know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/zyrxvo/outreach/issues) or emailing me at gbrown@physics.utoronto.ca.

## Programming

### [Level 0: Objects in Motion](https://github.com/zyrxvo/outreach/tree/main/Programming/Level 0)

**Approximate Length:** 1-2 hours

**Description:** Jump straight into programming with MIT's Scratch – an online platform to learn how to code using visual blocks. Go through, step-by-step, to make the cat move in a line and eventually a circle. Then transfer this knowledge into Python by writing your first Python program to do the same thing. Finish by playing around with MinuteLabs [Chaotic Planets](http://labs.minutelabs.io/ Chaotic-Planets/). 

**Requirements:** A computer and browser with internet access for each participant. No programming experience required (MIT Scratch and Python). Tablets/iPads can work, but the experience is best with a desktop browser.

**Notes:** The workshop uses the online coding platforms [MIT's Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) and [Trinket](https://trinket.io/). The workshop utilizes the free tiers of these platforms to provide a no-mess approach to get started with programming.

### [Level 1: The Motion of Oscillators and Pendulums using Computers (Coding Physics)](https://github.com/zyrxvo/outreach/tree/main/Programming/Level 1)

**Approximate Length:** 1-2 hours

**Description:** A brief review of how Newton's Laws can be used to describe the motion of objects. Starting from Newton’s 2nd Law, we will numerically solve the motion of the simple harmonic oscillator (mass on a spring) as well as the simple pendulum. We will then move on to experimenting with the double pendulum before closing on a discussion of chaos (as seen with the double pendulum).

**Requirements:** A computer and browser with internet access for each participant. Little to no programming experience required (Python and JavaScript). Tablets/iPads can work, but the experience is best with a desktop browser.

**Notes:** The workshop uses the online coding platforms [Trinket](https://trinket.io/) and [p5.js](https://editor.p5js.org/). The workshop utilizes the free tiers of these platforms to provide a no-mess approach to get started with programming.

### [Level 2: Gravity and the Three Body Problem](https://github.com/zyrxvo/outreach/tree/main/Programming/Level 2)

**Approximate Length:** 1.5-3 hours

**Description**: Starting from Newton’s 2nd Law, we will numerically solve the motion of the simple pendulum. We then go through a similar process for the two-body problem before reviewing vectors and going through the process one more time for the three body problem. We finish with a brief discussion of chaos (as seen with a double pendulum). Includes a brief review of vector addition.

**Requirements:** A computer and browser with internet access for each participant. Some programming experience would be helpful (Python). Tablets/iPads can work, but the experience is best with a desktop browser.

**Notes:** The workshop uses the online coding platform [Trinket](https://trinket.io/). The workshop Trinket to provide a no-mess approach to get started with programming in Python.
